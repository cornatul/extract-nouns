# Extract Nouns

This package can extract proper nouns from texts.
It takes a text string and can detect which words may be proper nouns of people, entities, etc.
It uses some heuristics like the capitalization of the first word letter, the presence of people title preceding the nouns, etc.
The class may consider consecutive proper names as a single proper name.
The class assumes English by default but may be configured to work with other idioms.

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
